#Factorial Dynamic Value (Paw Extension)

A Paw Extension that computes the [factorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of any number.

The purpose of this Extension is mainly to be an easy example of how to build Dynamic Values yourself (we don't expect many REST APIs to use the factorial function :D).
